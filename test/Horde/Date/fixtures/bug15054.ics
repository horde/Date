SUMMARY:Bug 15054
DESCRIPTION:Thunderbird creates a new event as "Jeden Werktag" (recurring
  all work days). \nThis is expressed as a DAILY clause with an BYDAY
  attribute listing the five workdays.\nHorde before this patch would only
  parse BYDAY from weeks. The server accepts the meeting but drops the
  restriction. The Event will be saved as "all days" and on next sync\,
  the TB user has an "all days" event rather than an "all work days"
  event.
